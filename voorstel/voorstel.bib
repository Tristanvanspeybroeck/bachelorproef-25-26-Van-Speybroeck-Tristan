  abstract       = {Artistic gymnastics is one of the most physically demanding sports, characterized by a high incidence of both acute and chronic injuries. Although previous research has primarily focused on biomechanical and training-related factors, the multifactorial etiology of injuries—including molecular and genetic aspects—remains insufficiently explored. This systematic review aimed to synthesize current evidence on the causes, mechanisms, and prevention of injuries in artistic gymnastics, with particular emphasis on biomechanical, molecular, and genetic determinants of injury risk and athletic performance. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database (Registration No: CRD420251167521). Electronic databases (PubMed, KoBSON, and Google Scholar) were searched for studies published between 2015 and 2025 using the keywords “gymnastics injuries,” “overuse injuries,” “injury prevention,” “biomechanics,” “IL-6,” “TNF-α,” and “miRNA biomarkers.” Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed based on injury incidence, localization, mechanisms, and molecular and genetic associations. The majority of injuries were localized in the joints of both upper and lower extremities, particularly during puberty and at higher competitive levels. Repetitive loading, improper technique, and insufficient recovery were identified as the main etiological factors. Molecular biomarkers such as IL-6, TNF-α, and miRNAs (miR-155, miR-146a) were found to play key roles in inflammatory responses, while genetic polymorphisms including ACTN3 R577X, ESR1 rs2234693, and CYP19A1 rs936306 were associated with flexibility, explosive strength, and susceptibility to injury. Injury prevention in artistic gymnastics requires a personalized and multidisciplinary approach that integrates biomechanical, clinical, molecular, and genetic data. Incorporating molecular and genetic profiling into training and rehabilitation programs may enhance early detection of overuse conditions and optimize both health and performance outcomes in gymnasts.},

  abstract = {The augmented feedback athletes receive from their coach is essential to improve performance. The aim of this exploratory study was to identify how coaches consider six feedback factors which might have an influence on the error-correction process. The six feedback factors were developed from a heuristic model of error correction, namely: a) visual perspective, b) visual experience, c) motor experience, d) personal relationship between coach and athlete, e) methodological knowledge, and f) biomechanical knowledge. Seventy-three active gymnastics coaches were asked to rank the importance and frequency of use of these six factors. In addition, we examined, in an exploratory way, if moderators can partly explain the weightings. Results show that the feedback factors can be ranked in importance and frequency of use, with methodological knowledge being the most essential in an error-correction situation. More studies are needed that explore if coaches should guide feedback according to their own motor experience. Gaze training for coaches is needed to improve the feedback and, ultimately, the movements.},

  abstract       = {Background: Motion capture (MoCap) technologies have transformed athlete monitoring, yet athletic departments face complex decisions when selecting systems for multiple sports. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed studies (2015–2025) examining optical marker-based, inertial measurement unit (IMU) systems, including Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-integrated systems, and markerless computer vision systems. Studies were evaluated for validated accuracy metrics across indoor court, aquatic, and outdoor field environments. Results: Optical systems maintain sub-millimeter accuracy in controlled environments but face field limitations. IMU systems demonstrate an angular accuracy of 2–8° depending on movement complexity. Markerless systems show variable accuracy (sagittal: 3–15°, transverse: 3–57°). Environmental factors substantially impact system performance, with aquatic settings introducing an additional orientation error of 2° versus terrestrial applications. Outdoor environments challenge GNSS-based tracking (±0.3–3 m positional accuracy). Critical gaps include limited gender-specific validation and insufficient long-term reliability data. Conclusions: This review proposes a tiered implementation framework combining foundation-level team monitoring with specialized assessment tools. This evidence-based approach guides the selection of technology aligned with organizational priorities, sport-specific requirements, and resource constraints.},

  abstract   = {In mobile application development, building a consistent user interface (UI) might be a costly and time-consuming process. This is especially the case if an organization has a separate team for each mobile platform such as iOS and Android. In this regard, the companies that choose the native mobile app development path end up going through do-overs as the UI work done on one platform needs to be repeated for other platforms too. One of the tedious parts of UI design tasks is creating a graphical user interface (GUI). There are numerous tools and prototypes in the literature that aim to create feasible GUI automation solutions to speed up this process and reduce the labor workload. However, as the technologies evolve and improve new versions of existing algorithms are created and offered. Accordingly, this study aims to employ the latest version of YOLO, which is YOLOv5, to create a custom object detection model that recognizes GUI elements in a given UI image. In order to benchmark the newly trained YOLOv5 GUI element detection model, existing work from the literature and their data set is considered and used for comparison purposes. Therefore, this study makes use of 450 UI samples of the VINS dataset for testing, a similar amount for validation and the rest for model training. Then the findings of this work are compared with another study that has used the SSD algorithm and VINS dataset to train, validate and test its model, which showed that proposed algorithm outperformed SSD's mean average precision (mAP) by 15.69{\%}.},

  abstract = {IntroductionThis study aimed to quantify kinematic relationships across body segments during forehand strokes to provide interpretable metrics for single-camera based lightweight table tennis diagnostics.MethodsWe analyzed 34 female players (aged 9.1–21.7 years) from provincial teams, recording a total of 340 strokes (10 per player). An SVM model was used to predict ball speed, after which 320 strokes (8–10 per player) were retained by removing outliers in ball speed. From MediaPipe position time series, we calculated velocity, angle and angular velocity time series, and extracted kinematic parameters from these time series, including range, mean/peak/impact values. Within-subject correlation coefficients (rws) were calculated to identify key biomechanical parameters that contribute to the ball speed, while between-subject correlation coefficients (rbs) were used to detect the relationship between age/height and ball speed.ResultsBall speed increased with greater playing-side arm linear movement at the shoulder (rws = 0.51 to 0.63), elbow (rws = 0.63 to 0.70) and wrist (rws = 0.50 to 0.60), as well as with enhanced rotational motion at the playing-side upper arm (rws = 0.65 to 0.71), shoulder line (rws = 0.54 to 0.57), and hip line (rws = 0.51 to 0.59). Conversely, ball speed decreased with excessive contralateral shoulder horizontal flexion/extension (rws = −0.44 to −0.62) and playing-side elbow flexion-extension (rws = −0.35). At the population-level, ball speed increases with age before 14.3 years (rbs = 0.68) but plateaus thereafter (rbs = 0.17).DiscussionThis MediaPipe-based framework demonstrates potential for efficient biomechanical analysis in table tennis, providing a promising foundation for lightweight real-time analysis solutions.},
