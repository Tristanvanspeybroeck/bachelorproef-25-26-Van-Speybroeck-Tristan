  abstract       = {Artistic gymnastics is one of the most physically demanding sports, characterized by a high incidence of both acute and chronic injuries. Although previous research has primarily focused on biomechanical and training-related factors, the multifactorial etiology of injuries—including molecular and genetic aspects—remains insufficiently explored. This systematic review aimed to synthesize current evidence on the causes, mechanisms, and prevention of injuries in artistic gymnastics, with particular emphasis on biomechanical, molecular, and genetic determinants of injury risk and athletic performance. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database (Registration No: CRD420251167521). Electronic databases (PubMed, KoBSON, and Google Scholar) were searched for studies published between 2015 and 2025 using the keywords “gymnastics injuries,” “overuse injuries,” “injury prevention,” “biomechanics,” “IL-6,” “TNF-α,” and “miRNA biomarkers.” Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed based on injury incidence, localization, mechanisms, and molecular and genetic associations. The majority of injuries were localized in the joints of both upper and lower extremities, particularly during puberty and at higher competitive levels. Repetitive loading, improper technique, and insufficient recovery were identified as the main etiological factors. Molecular biomarkers such as IL-6, TNF-α, and miRNAs (miR-155, miR-146a) were found to play key roles in inflammatory responses, while genetic polymorphisms including ACTN3 R577X, ESR1 rs2234693, and CYP19A1 rs936306 were associated with flexibility, explosive strength, and susceptibility to injury. Injury prevention in artistic gymnastics requires a personalized and multidisciplinary approach that integrates biomechanical, clinical, molecular, and genetic data. Incorporating molecular and genetic profiling into training and rehabilitation programs may enhance early detection of overuse conditions and optimize both health and performance outcomes in gymnasts.},
